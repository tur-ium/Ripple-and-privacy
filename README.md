## Uniqueness calculations for 01/06/2017 to 29/08/2017

It is worth noting that these results differ from the values calculated by DiLuzio et. al. [1] on the data from 2013 - 2015.

Possible factors:
1. There has been a dramatic change in the value of XRP, so the generalisation of data may not be comparable
2. We are calculating some different value
3. There is a mistake somewhere
